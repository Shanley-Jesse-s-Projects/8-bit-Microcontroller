# 8-bit-Microcontroller
ESET 349 Final Project:
Authors: Jesse Rosart-Brodnitz, Shanley Mullen

Project: Creation of an 8-bit microcontroller that displays the results on seven segment display. 
A Texas Instruments DE10-Lite board and a TM4c123gh6pm launchpad were used for this project. 
Programming done in Assembly and Verilog. 

Two different approaches were developed and they were broken up into part A and part B. The first method being wiring the inputs straight into flip-flops to be converted and display the output. The second method involving the wiring of an ALU to be converted to the output. While there are many other methods to go about creating simple 8-bit microcontrollers, these two methods are fairly straightforward and a good stepping point for anyone starting to dabble in microcontrollers. 

Jesse Rosart-Brodnitz was the lead for part B of the project while Shanley Mullen was the lead for part A.
